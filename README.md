# DSC501
This repository is for my final project is DSC501, Introduction to Data Science

The project set out to find if NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions) held an effect 
on the COVID-19 outbreak of 2020.

The final project consists of a Jupyter notebook running a Julia 1.5.2 kernel
and csv datasets.
